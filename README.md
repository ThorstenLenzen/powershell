## Copy-FolderStructure
Copies all folders from the source folder, including 
the folder, to the target folder. It just copies the 
folders, not the files contained within them.

## Copy-Items-WithExclude
Copies all the items of a given source folder structure recursively to 
a target folder structure, but it does not copy the items, which are 
matched by the exclude pattern.
